Monroe is [nREPL](https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl) client for
Emacs, focused on simplicity and easy distribution primarily targeting
Clojure users.

If you are not familiar with nREPL, it is protocol for accessing
Clojure [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop) over
the network.

In short, Monroe aims to have:

* easy access to Clojure REPL via nREPL protocol
* simple installation without any dependencies, except Emacs
* REPL with colors and history support
* generic approach - you can use it with other languages than Clojure
* only REPL for interaction with shortcuts - no funny windows or buffers with errors,
  messages and other distractions

On other hand, Monroe is not:

* Clojure IDE like [Cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider)
* Kitchen sink that will do Clojure work for you

## Installation

Make sure you have `clojure-mode.el` installed first. You can get it
from Marmalade repository or directly from
[here](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode).

Official Monroe releases you can find on
[releases](https://github.com/sanel/monroe/releases) page or you can
get it from Marmalade repository of Emacs packages (you are familiar
with Emacs packages, right?).

Latest (and maybe unstable) code you can always get from this
repository or MELPA repository of Emacs packages.

If you get Monroe by downloading official release or by cloning this
repository, you can install it by moving `monroe.el` file in
`$HOME/.emacs.d` folder or any other location listed in Emacs
`load-path` variable. Installing via Emacs package manager will do
this automatically.

In your
[Emacs init file](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html),
put:

```el
(require 'monroe)
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'clojure-enable-monroe)
```

Then, in Emacs:

<kbd>M-x monroe [RET]</kbd>

and follow the question about nREPL server location and port.

## Keys and shortcuts

### Monroe shortcuts for code buffer

These shortcuts are valid from code buffer where you edit Clojure
code and where *monroe-interaction-mode* is activated.

Keys                | Description
--------------------|----------------------------
<kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>  | Evaluate expression at point.
<kbd>C-c C-l</kbd>  | Load a file.
<kbd>C-c C-r</kbd>  | Evaluate region.
<kbd>C-c C-k</kbd>  | Evaluate current buffer.
<kbd>C-c C-d</kbd>  | Describe symbol at point, showing documentation in REPL window.
<kbd>C-c C-n</kbd>  | Evaluate namespace.
<kbd>C-c C-b</kbd>  | Interrupt running job.
<kbd>M-.</kbd>      | Jump to definition of var at point.
<kbd>M-,</kbd>      | Jump back to where you were before you did `M-.`

### Monroe shortcuts for REPL buffer

These shortcuts are valid in REPL buffer; also, most of the standard
*comint-mode* shortcuts should work without problems.

Keys                | Description
--------------------|----------------------------
<kbd>C-c C-d</kbd>  | Describe symbol at point, showing documentation in REPL window.
<kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>  | Interrupt running job.
